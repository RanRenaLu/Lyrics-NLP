### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: What Can Lyrics Tell Us?
+ This project is conducted by Ran (Rena) Lu

+ Project summary: Music has always been a very important part of our lives, and we can easily fall in love with songs without knowing the lyrics. However, a well-written lyric should always be adored as it is a primary tool for the listeners to connect with the songwriter. Being able to understand the words of the lyrics, we can access what is in their mind. In this project, we will focus on the genre and the time of publishing for songs to analyze the lyrics by data visualization and sentiment analysis.
